# Winmugen Page 2021.

You found my page or code on my github, so welcome!

I have tried to make it my best work, so I do the best I can with everything I have learned thanks to the University!

This page was made for the sole purpose of showing my work throughout this time. 

From 2018 to 2023!

This time on 03/03/2024 I have made a gigantic improvement to the page, making  everything more orderly.
