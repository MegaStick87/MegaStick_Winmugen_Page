# Winmugen Page 2021.

You found my page or code on my github, so welcome!

I have tried to make it my best work, so I do the best I can with everything I have learned thanks to the University!

This page was made for the sole purpose of showing my work throughout this time. 

From 2018 to 20?? 

So, I hope I can continue learning to improve this site in the future. :D

## Planned future improvements.

- Make a better UI.

- Fix bugs in code. 

- Add animations with real time effects using JS in the future. (Explods anims)

- Change the page where my chars are presented completely.

- Improvements in the main menu.

- And more!!
